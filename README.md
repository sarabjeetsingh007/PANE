# PANE
Pluggable Asynchronous Network-on-Chip Simulator
Version V5.0

We propose a pluggable asynchronous network-on-chip (PANE) simulator that supports modeling and analysis of synchronous, asynchronous and mixed synchronous-asynchronous NoCs. Pluggable Asynchronous Network on Chip simulator (PANE) is an event-driven synchronous, asynchronous, mixed synchronous-asynchronous and multi-clock domain NoC simulator. Event-modeling not only supports asynchronous communication but also allows PANE to model variability in synchronous routers and NoCs. PANE models handshake-based asynchronous timing- control paths. It allows easy modeling for a variety of NoC designs with different topologies, routing algorithms, allocation and arbitration mechanisms, buffering schemes and workloads. PANEâ€™s design allows for simulation of separate, yet interacting implementations of the data, routing-control and timing-control paths of the NoC, partly at the cost of simulation time. Asynchronous timing-control-path modeled in PANE supports bundled data as well as quasi delay-insensitive (QDI) asynchronous data-transfer protocols. PANE builds on the implementations of data and routing control paths in synchronous NoC while providing mechanisms to implement asynchronous handshake. This allows PANE framework to stay at par with the synchronous NoC design tools available.
